# AWS--Realestate-Market
Automation written in YAML on AWS CloudFormation

This project was to create a database with data required by the property market. The actual functions were written in python and cannot be uploaded. 

HOWEVER the entire project was to work autonomously and this was achieved by using AWS Cloudformation. This template was written in yaml and once its
deployed on AWS it creates various resources which were vital to the project including the fucntions.
